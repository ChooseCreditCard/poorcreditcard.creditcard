  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What “Poor Credit” Means in Practice</h2>
    <p>“Poor credit” is not a moral label — it simply means lenders see higher risk based on your file. This can come from:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Missed or late payments in the past</li>
      <li>Defaults or collections</li>
      <li>Very high existing debt</li>
      <li>No or very short credit history (“thin file”)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With poor or limited credit, you are less likely to be approved for premium rewards cards — but there are still products designed specifically to help you build a track record.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Card Types -->
  <section id="types" class="section">
    <h2>Types of Cards Aimed at Poor or Limited Credit</h2>
    <p>Most “poor credit” card offers fall into a few clear categories:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Secured credit cards:</strong> you pay a refundable deposit which often equals your credit limit.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit-builder cards:</strong> low starting limits, simple structures, often with reporting to all major bureaus.</li>
      <li><strong>Store or private-label cards:</strong> restricted to specific merchants, sometimes easier approvals.</li>
      <li><strong>Subprime unsecured cards:</strong> unsecured but with high fees and interest — often the least attractive option.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Structurally similar cards can behave very differently depending on fees, reporting and how the issuer treats late payments.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Key Things to Watch Out For</h2>
    <p>When your credit is weak, offers can become more aggressive and confusing. Watch especially for:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>High annual or monthly fees:</strong> some cards charge multiple small “maintenance” fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Setup and activation fees:</strong> money you pay before even using the card.</li>
      <li><strong>Very high APRs:</strong> carrying a balance becomes extremely expensive.</li>
      <li><strong>Low starting limits:</strong> easy to max out and hurt your utilization.</li>
      <li><strong>Unclear reporting:</strong> if the card doesn’t report to main bureaus, it may not help you build.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A simple, transparent secured or builder card is often safer than a flashy subprime unsecured card covered in small-print fees.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Using a Poor-Credit Card to Rebuild</h2>
    <p>If you decide to get a card while your credit is weak, you can use it as a tool:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Keep utilization low (e.g. use less than 30% of your limit, ideally under 10%).</li>
      <li>Pay the full statement balance on time, every time.</li>
      <li>Set up automatic payments to avoid accidental misses.</li>
      <li>Ignore rewards and focus purely on stability and reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After consistent on-time payments over many months, you may qualify for better products with lower fees and higher limits.</p>
