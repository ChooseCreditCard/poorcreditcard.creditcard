  <!-- Understanding poor credit -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What counts as “poor credit”?</h2>
    <p class="small">
      Poor credit typically refers to a credit score below the range accepted for most mainstream cards.
      Common causes include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• Late or missed payments</li>
      <li>• Collections or charge-offs</li>
      <li>• High credit utilization</li>
      <li>• Very short credit history</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Best card types -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Best card types for poor credit</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Secured credit cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Highest approval rates. Deposit-funded limits reduce lender risk.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Low-limit unsecured cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          No deposit required. Starts small and grows with good behavior.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Credit builder programs</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Hybrid products with reporting, subscriptions, and virtual cards.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Retail/store cards</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Easier approval, but usually high interest and limited usability.
        </p>

  <!-- Rebuilding strategy -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>A simple rebuilding plan</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• Pay every statement on time (this matters more than anything)</li>
      <li>• Keep balances under 30% of your limit</li>
      <li>• Don’t apply for too many cards at once</li>
      <li>• Use the card every month, even in small amounts</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Approval expectations -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What to expect with poor credit approvals</h2>
    <p class="small">Issuers may offer:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• Lower starting limits</li>
      <li>• Higher APR</li>
      <li>• Fewer perks (initially)</li>
      <li>• Upgrade review after 6–18 months</li>
