    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a “Poor Credit” Card?</h2>
      <p>A “poor credit” card is usually aimed at people with late payments, collections, defaults, or very limited credit history. Instead of competing on premium rewards, these products focus on basic access to card payments while reporting to credit bureaus.</p>
      <p>They often come with <strong>higher fees, lower limits</strong> and a stricter set of rules. In return, the issuer takes on more risk and uses the account history to update your credit file every month – which can help over time if payments are made on time and balances are kept under control.</p>
      <p>This minisite is <strong>educational only</strong>. It does not recommend specific cards or providers, and it does not provide personal financial advice.</p>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Poor-Credit &amp; Rebuild Cards Typically Work</h2>
      <p>Products for poor credit can be unsecured (no deposit) or secured (you pay a refundable deposit that backs the limit). Common patterns include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low starting limit:</strong> The issuer may start with a small line of credit and review it after several months of on-time payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher APR and fees:</strong> Interest rates and annual fees are often higher than on mainstream cards, reflecting the higher risk profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Mandatory reporting:</strong> Many of these cards report to one or more credit bureaus, which means both good and bad behaviour show up on your file.</li>
        <li><strong>Fewer perks:</strong> Travel insurance, lounges and advanced rewards are usually not the focus; the main “feature” is the ability to rebuild over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The key is not the brand, but <strong>how the issuer reports</strong>, what it costs to keep the account open and how forgiving the terms are if something goes wrong.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Rebuild considerations -->
    <section id="rebuild" class="section">
      <h2>Using a Card to Rebuild – Key Considerations</h2>
      <p>When you look at a card designed for poor credit, there are a few structured questions to ask in the pricing and terms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Can I afford the worst-case cost?</strong> Check annual fee, monthly fees, late fees and interest. A rebuild product should not trap you in high-cost debt.</li>
        <li><strong>How will this report?</strong> Make sure you understand which bureaus receive data and how often; rebuilding is slower if the issuer reports narrowly or sporadically.</li>
        <li><strong>Is there a path to better terms?</strong> Some issuers review accounts after 6–12 months and offer limit increases, lower fees or upgrades to more mainstream products.</li>
        <li><strong>What happens if I miss a payment?</strong> Clarify penalty APR, fees and how quickly negative events are reported.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For many people, the most important part of a rebuild card is not the reward structure, but the combination of <strong>predictable cost</strong> and <strong>reliable reporting</strong>.</p>
