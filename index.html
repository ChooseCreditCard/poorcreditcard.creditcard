  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What Is a Credit Card for Poor Credit?</h2>
    <p>Cards for poor credit are designed for people with low scores or thin credit files. They focus on rebuilding rather than rewards, typically offering low starting limits or requiring a refundable security deposit.</p>
    <p>The main goal is access and credit rehabilitation: enabling safe, predictable spending while reporting your activity to major credit bureaus.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Mechanics -->
  <section id="mechanics" class="section">
    <h2>How Secured & Low-Limit Cards Work</h2>
    <p>Secured cards require an upfront deposit that becomes your credit line. The issuer holds this deposit as collateral, reducing their risk and allowing approvals for people with poor credit.</p>
    <p>Low-limit unsecured cards work differently: they extend a small credit line without a deposit, but may come with higher fees or stricter underwriting. In both cases, responsible use and on-time payments help improve your credit over time.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Who Benefits Most From These Cards?</h2>
    <p>These products help people recovering from financial setbacks, building credit from scratch or rebuilding after long periods without active credit accounts. They are structured to support small transactions and predictable payment patterns.</p>
    <p>Frequent, low-risk payments that are paid off each month tend to provide the best long-term results.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Fees, Requirements & Considerations</h2>
    <p>Some cards may charge annual fees, setup fees or higher interest rates. Deposits typically range from $200 to $1,000, depending on issuer rules. After several months of positive activity, some issuers offer deposit refunds, limit increases or upgrades to unsecured cards.</p>
    <p>Understanding reporting schedules and avoiding late payments is critical — one missed payment can undo months of progress.</p>
